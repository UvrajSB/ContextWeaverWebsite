            <p>
              We respect your right to control your personal data. This page explains how to request that{" "}
              <strong>Bluestar</strong> delete the personal information we hold about you, including any data
              tied to your interactions with our WhatsApp Business integration.
            </p>

            <h2>What gets deleted</h2>
            <p>On a verified deletion request we will delete or irreversibly anonymise:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your account profile (name, email, role, organisation membership).</li>
              <li>
                Your WhatsApp identifiers (phone number, WhatsApp display name) and all message history
                exchanged between you and Bluestar on WhatsApp.
              </li>
              <li>Attachments, media, and voice notes you sent through WhatsApp.</li>
              <li>Activity logs and diagnostic records that can be associated with you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Some records may need to be retained for a limited period to satisfy legal, tax, or audit
              obligations, or to resolve disputes. Where this is the case the data will be access-restricted
              and deleted as soon as the obligation ends.
            </p>

            <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
            <p>You have two options:</p>

            <h3>Option 1 &mdash; Email us</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Send an email to <a href={MAIL_SUBJECT}>{MAIL}</a> from the email address associated with your
                account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the subject line: <strong>Data Deletion Request</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the body, include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Your full name.</li>
                  <li>The email address linked to your Bluestar account.</li>
                  <li>
                    The WhatsApp phone number you have used with Bluestar (in international format, e.g.{" "}
                    <code>+91 98xxxxxx00</code>), if applicable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A short statement: &ldquo;I request deletion of my personal data from Bluestar.&rdquo;
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Option 2 &mdash; Reply on WhatsApp</h3>
            <p>
              From the same WhatsApp number you used to contact Bluestar, send the message{" "}
              <strong>DELETE MY DATA</strong>. Our team will reply to confirm your identity and process the
              request.
            </p>

            <h2>What happens next</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                We will acknowledge your request within <strong>3 business days</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may ask one or two follow-up questions to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent
                deletion of someone else&rsquo;s account.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will complete the deletion within <strong>30 days</strong> of verifying your request, and
                confirm in writing once it is done.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we cannot delete certain data (for example, because it is required by law), we will explain
                why and tell you when it will be deleted.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Stop receiving WhatsApp messages</h2>
            <p>
              If you only want to stop receiving WhatsApp messages from Bluestar (without deleting your
              account), reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any WhatsApp message we send you. We will end the
              conversation and stop further outbound messages on that number.
            </p>

            <h2>Cost</h2>
            <p>
              Submitting a deletion request is free. We will not charge you to exercise your data-protection
              rights.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
              If you have any questions about this process, email us at <a href={`mailto:${MAIL}`}>{MAIL}</a>.
            </p>
